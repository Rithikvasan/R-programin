6. There is a popular built-in data set in R called &quot;mtcars&quot; (Motor Trend Car Road Tests),
which is retrieved from the 1974 Motor Trend US Magazine.
(i)Find the dimension of the data set &amp; Give the statistical summary of the features.
(ii)Create correlation matrix between mpg vs all other features and print the high 3
correlated Features(both +ve and -ve)
(iii)Plot the Box plot for “mpg” group by “cyl” feature.
(iv)Create a scatter plot graph for the relation between &quot;mpg&quot;(miles per gallon) and
&quot;hp&quot;(horse power) group by cyl(number ofcylinder)
Sample Output:

(v) Generate a multiple regression model to establish the relationship between &quot;mpg&quot;
as a response variable with &quot;disp&quot;,&quot;hp&quot; and &quot;wt&quot; as predictor variables. Plot the
regression line. Find the MSE of the model.
